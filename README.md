###News reader app using tabris js

A simple tabris app.
This app is a simple app using [tabris.js](http://tabrisjs.com)
 to show you how to create a news reader app.
It's just a simple.So it doesn't contain hybrid app features such as  **bookmark** , **localstorage** and some others.
Used the next web news api from [NewsAPI](newsapi.org).
